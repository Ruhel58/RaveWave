 Make sure node js is installed before running any commands or the program.
 Before running the program, make sure that the node package modules are installed. To install, run 'npm install'.
 
 To run the frontend of the program, change the working directory (cd client) to the client folder and run 'npm start'.  

 To run the backend of the program, make sure you are in the "server" directory. Open a separate terminal and run 'npm start'. 

 To access the frontend, enter 'http://localhost:3000/' in a web browser.
 
The config folder holds the keys needed to connect to the server. It is not in the repository for security reasons. It gets ignored by git. To obtain the config folder, speak with Ruhel or email ec17170@qmul.ac.uk.

 Everything is in development mode and has not been built.
